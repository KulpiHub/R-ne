sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: look like algorythm has O(n^2), least efficient

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: the fastest of 3 algorythms, for sure it is merge sort as it has time complexity of O(nlogn)

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: looks like algorythm has O(n^2) time complexity, but is stil more efficient than sort1
